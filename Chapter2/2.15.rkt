;; She is right. Due the arithmetic precision machine the formula to compute the parallel resistor par2 is better.
;; The division of a number my a small number produces a big number which is better than the backwards, bacause of
;; machine precision of floating point numbers.
;; Also, a one can verify that the width for par2 is smaller than par1.
